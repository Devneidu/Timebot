i havent been into programming for long
 now so i don't know if i am to call my object a 
 fra,ework or an API;

 The idea came to me when i was doing a project on 
 CMS ... wanted to create a class to Remove ban from users
 after over a period of time.

 i saw that this same function can also be used as an 
 alarm or otherwise. 

 so once the code is in the script it runs and automatically 
 carries out the function you want it to.

 So like when you ban a user and store the date in the database,
 you can retrieve it and add 3days from the initial ban.
 so when it gets to the date the ban is to be removed, it makes use 
 of default time zone Nigeria and removes the ban.
